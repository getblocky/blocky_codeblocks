    <p>So you're looking at the Python editor and wondering what to do. That's
    easy! Let's learn about the different parts of the editor. First of all,
    there are some buttons across the top:</p>

    <p><img src="static/img/header.png" class="img-responsive center-block"
        alt="A picture of the buttons along the top of the editor."/></p>

    <p>Pressing the TAB key will move the focus between the buttons. Pressing
    ENTER will activate the highlighted button. If you're in the text window
    (see below) you'll need to press the ESCAPE key to re-focus on the buttons.
    You can, of course, use your mouse.</p>

    <p>What do they do?</p>

    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="static/img/download.png" alt="Download button"/>
            </td>
            <td>
            Click on the "Download" button to save a special "hex" file on
            your computer. Plug in your BBC micro:bit (it'll show up as USB
            storage) and drag the newly saved file onto the device. Your code
            will run (or you'll see an error message scroll past on the
            device's display). See below for how to extract your code from a
            hex file back into the editor.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="static/img/save.png" alt="Save button"/>
            </td>
            <td>
            Click on the "Save" button to save your code onto your computer.
            Because you're downloading Python code your computer might check
            you want to save the file. It's trying to protect you from
            downloading random software from the internet. But since this is
            your own code you're safe to proceed. See below for how to load
            code back into the editor.
            </td>

            </td>
            <td>
            It's very easy to load files from your computer into the editor:
            click the load button then drag the file from your computer onto
            the grey "drop" area. Alternatively, you could use the file
            picker (just click on the link at the bottom to toggle between the
            two options). The editor knows how to read Python files (whose name
            ends with ".py") and extract Python code from hex files (whose name
            ends with ".hex").
            </td>

            <td>
            <strong>This is an experimental feature. It may change in future
            and could contain bugs.</strong> Clicking the "Blockly" button
            displays a set of drag-and-drop
            blocks that can be used to quickly create Python code. Move the
            blocks, watch Python code appear and change. <strong>Moving such
            blocks will re-write your Python code and you may lose work.
            Furthermore, the arrangement of blocks is currently not saved,
            just the resulting Python code.</strong>

            <td>
            Clicking on the "Snippets" button brings up a menu of Python
            short-cuts (snippets). Code snippets are short blocks of code to
            re-use in your own programs. There are snippets for most common
            things you'll want to do with Python. Select the one you want and
            fill in the gaps in the code editor to make it do what you want.
            <strong>Snippets are disabled when blockly is enabled.</strong>

            Clicking on the "Help" button gets you here. But you knew that
            already, right..? :-) Notice that your editor is still available
            but in a separate tab in your browser.

            Clicking on the "Share" button creates a unique link that points to
            your script. Add this link to your bookmarks to retrieve your code.
            If you share this link others will be able to see your code. So
            your code remains private you must set a password and an optional
            password hint for it. <strong>This button is not available if
            you're running the editor from a local file system.</strong>
            </td>

            Everyone likes to show off their awesome Python skills. These
            buttons are especially useful to zoom-in and zoom-out when you're
            trying to show your code to a large group of people via a
            projector.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The name and description for your script is shown on the top
    right hand side. Click them to edit them.</p>

    <p>The other part of the editor is the text window:</p>

    <p><img src="static/img/editor_text.png"
        class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded"
        alt="A picture of the text area in the code editor."/></p>

    <p>It's very simple to use. Just click and type.</p>

    <p>The editor tries to help you out by colouring the text to show what
    all the different parts of your program are. For example, Python keywords
    (words built into the Python language) are grey. The brighter coloured
    words are bits of the program <em>you</em> have created. Brown words
    are constant values that never change and purple words represent
    strings of characters to display. All the lines are numbered with the
    current line highlighted.</p>

    <p>Do you want to see how the editor actually works? It's easy, to view
    the "source code" press CTRL-U (or CMD-U on a Mac). There's a secret
    message for you in the code. Can you find it?</p>

    <img src="static/img/comic2.png" class="img-responsive center-block"
        alt="http://goo.gl/ArpNbM"/>

    <h2 id="hello">Hello, World!</h2>

    <p><img src="static/img/comic3.png" class="img-responsive center-block"
        alt="http://goo.gl/zpfrsY"/></p>

    <p>The version of Python that runs on the BBC micro:bit is called
    MicroPython. It's exactly like <em>real</em> Python except it's designed
    to run on small devices like the BBC micro:bit. Here's the MicroPython code
    you need to make your BBC micro:bit say "Hello, World!". Copy and paste it
    into the Python editor, download it and copy it onto your device (just like
    Yellow and Blue suggest):</p>

    <pre><code class="python">from microbit import *


display.scroll("Hello, World!")</code></pre>

    <p>The first line (<code>from microbit import *</code>) tells MicroPython
    to get all the bits of Python needed to program the micro:bit.</p>

    <p>The second line(<code>display.scroll("Hello, World!")</code>) tells
    MicroPython to use one of those bits of Python (the <code>display</code>
    module) to scroll the text, <kbd>"Hello, World!"</kbd> across the physical
    display on the front of the device. It's all remarkably obvious. If you
    followed Yellow and Blue's instructions you should see something like
    this:</p>

    <p><img src="static/img/scroll-hello.gif" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded"
        alt="An animation of 'hello world' scrolling over the display."/></p>

    <p>Can you make it scroll any other messages? Why not try making your
    BBC micro:bit scroll your name? Remember, MicroPython will scroll
    everything between the <code>"</code>quotation marks<code>"</code>.</p>

    <h2 id="blockly">Blockly</h2>

    <p>Use blockly to make new Python code from easy to assemble blocks of
    code.</p>

    <p><img src="static/img/blocks.png"
        class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded"
        alt="An animation demonstrating how to use snippets."/></p>

    <p>Blockly updates Python in the code editor as you move blocks around.
    There are lots of different blocks to cover all the features of the
    micro:bit. You can make more advanced code by combining blocks together
    (such as in the example above).</p>

    <p>You should use Blockly to create <em>new code</em> since moving blocks
    around will overwrite any existing code you have in the editor (and you may
    lose work as a result). The arrangement of blocks isn't (currently)
    saved, so Blockly makes a great way to make simple Python code without
    lots of typing. In the end, you'll learn that simply typing Python is by
    far the quickest and easiest way to write code.</p>

    <p>Not all the features of the micro:bit or MicroPython are available via
    Blockly. We've done this on purpose. Some of the more advanced and
    interesting stuff is only available in pure Python.</p>

    <p>However, by using Blockly you'll very quickly get the hang of how Python
    code works and fits together.</p>

    <h2 id="snippets">Snippets</h2>

    <p>Snippets are a cool way to avoid typing. The animation below shows you
    how to use them:</p>

    <p><img src="static/img/snippet_example.gif"
        class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded"
        alt="An animation demonstrating how to use snippets."/></p>

    <p>You can access snippets from the "Snippets" button (see above), but
    it's a lot quicker and easier to learn the <em>triggers</em> for the
    different fragments of code, hit the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key to expand the
    snippet and then fill in the remaining blocks of code so it does what you
    want.</p>

    <p>When blockly is enabled the "Snippets" button is disabled. This avoids
    snippets from interfering with code that blockly may be generating.</p>

    <p><img src="static/img/comic4.png" class="img-responsive center-block"
        alt="http://goo.gl/bT8a8M"/></p>

    <h2 id="bugs">Bug Fixes</h2>

    <p>Things will go wrong!</p>

    <p>You have to imagine Python is the most strict English teacher in the
    universe... yes, even more strict than that really strict one you have at
    your school. Put simply, <strong>you have to type Python without any
    mistakes</strong> for it to work.</p>

    <p>All programmers make mistakes and create bugs. It's a fact of life.
    When you have a bug MicroPython tries to help you out: it will scroll a
    message on its display. It may even include a line number. This message is
    like the first clue in a treasure hunt, you have to figure out the rest
    yourself.</p>

    <p>Common bugs include <em>Syntax Errors</em> (which means you've typed it in
    wrong) and <em>Name Errors</em> (that mean you've typed in correct Python, but
    it can't work out what you're coding about).</p>

    <p>If you're unsure what to do
    <a href="https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">go read the
    MicroPython docs</a>. Alternatively, just ask someone who knows what they're
    doing. If no such person is available you could just follow this handy flow
    chart:</p>

        alt="http://goo.gl/q5DAAW"/></p>

    <p>Python makes it simple to write powerful programs. Can you work out what
    this program does?</p>

    <pre><code class="python"># Press button A for a fortune cookie.
from microbit import *
import random


fortunes = [
    "Never step off a moving bus",
    "This sentence is false",
    "The meaning of life is overrated",
    "Do not touch!",
    "You will receive some advice",
    "My hovercraft is full of eels",
    ]


while True:
    if button_a.is_pressed():
        cookie = random.choice(fortunes)
        display.scroll(cookie)</code></pre>
